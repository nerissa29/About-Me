The About Me Project is a webpage that prompts the user 5 fun facts, giving the user a hint or some information about the author. After answering 5 questions, the user will have a glimpse of the author’s bio.

Questions include:
-Do I have kids?;
-Do I have a pet named Petra?
-Did I served in the military?
-Did I work as a Yeoman in admin department?
-Am I on my 30's?

## Reflections and Comments

Building the webpage structure can be tricky but fun. One needs to know what exactly one wants to accomplish. Such struggles include how I should lay out my bio. What questions should I ask the user that will give them some information about me? The hardest part is how to get all these together.

The biggest struggle is pushing it to the correct directory with the right git command. I indeed need to practice and get used to using git commands. I am hoping to be better on the upcoming projects. More practice it is, and a lot of catching up to do.
